## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues and specs tracked as local Markdown files under `.scratch/`. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Default five canonical triage roles (`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`). See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: `CONTEXT.md` at repo root (created lazily once the first term is resolved). See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
